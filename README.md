============

Our goal is to allow the user to cut not only based on when the mean value of a window falls below a threshold, but also when the standard deviation or variance of the quality scores in a window exceeds some threshold.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
The first step we propose to accomplish, is produce a table that the user can use as a guide to set his/hers threshold values:

WindowPosition,MeanQuality,SDQuality
1,35,2.57
2,37,2.89
3,38,3.00
...
15, 20, 10.00
16,15, 11.22
