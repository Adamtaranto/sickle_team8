The goal: produce some summary stats that will allow the user to decide where to cut

1. Test for which phred scoring scale is being used
	fastq: ascii offset of 33 (illumina 1.8) has range from 0 to 93
	fastq-solexa: ascii offset of 64 (illumina early) range -5 to 62
	fastq-illumina: same as fastq-solexa but range is 0 to 62 (illumina 1.3 to 1.7)

2. Test window size is not too long compared to read length

3. Build Class Sequence
	read_id
	sequence
	quality score
	methods in class:
		mean quality score for read -> float
		sd quality score for read -> float
		mean quality score along a window -> dictionary{window_pos:{mean:mean quality,sd:sd quality}}
		trimm

4. function parse the seq.record object into Sequence Class

5. dictionary{read_id:Sequence class}

6. function that will summarise data for output based on the dictionary in step 5
